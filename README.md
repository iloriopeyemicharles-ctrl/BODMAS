## 🎓 BODMAS Tutor
BODMAS Tutor is a simple Python tool that helps learners understand and practise arithmetic expressions using the BODMAS rule — Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. It breaks expressions down step by step, making it easier for students to follow the correct order of operations.

## ✨ Features
-	Solves arithmetic expressions using the BODMAS rule
-	Shows each step clearly and simply
-	Beginner-friendly
-	Useful for students, teachers, and self-learners

## 🧠 How It Works
BODMAS Tutor evaluates expressions using a structured pipeline:
1.	Parse the expression: Tokenises numbers, operators, and brackets.
2.	Apply BODMAS hierarchy: Determine the correct order of operations.
3.	Solve step-by-step: Each operation is executed and explained in plain language.
4.	Return final answer + explanation: Users see both the solution and the reasoning behind it.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1.	Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/iloriopeyemicharles-ctrl/BODMAS
3.	Move into the project folder: cd BODMAS
4.	Run the Python file: python bodmas.py
5.  Once the script starts, follow the on-screen prompts to enter an expression and view the step-by-step solution.
